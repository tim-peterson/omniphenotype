# omniphenotype
Code for the `Cell fitness is an omniphenotype` paper.

Code to generate data for each figure was written in python, R, Perl, PHP, or MySQL. The underlying data can be accessed as described in the methods.

### Figure 1
- NIH grant data is available to download from the [NIH RePORTER website](https://exporter.nih.gov/ExPORTER_Catalog.aspx)
- Huttlin (Bioplex) data is available to download from [their website](https://bioplex.hms.harvard.edu/interactions.php)
- Figure 1.R has code to intersect this data with that of the DepMap


### Figure 3

- figure3A.sql has multiple MySQL commands that are needed to generate the data shown in Figure 3A.

- Any gene cluster can be input into the figure3B.py script to yield the data that can be converted into the volcano plot as shown in Figure 3B.

- Figure 3B statistics (enrichment analysis) was performed using SciPy. The code is available via [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17Ib8tomocbfb6Hz8owC-HQwja3uYOciu?usp=sharing) 
### Figure 4

- For the common disease restricted analysis in Figure S1, preceeding this analysis, we dumped all of PubMed into a MySQL database table, which we then queried for the co-occurrence of `{gene} AND {condition}`. 

### Figure 5

- [Guzzle](http://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/stable/), which is a PHP library to make HTTP requests, is required to run Figure 5 code.
